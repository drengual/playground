## 01: Beyond looking "modern and fresh" what is the #1 goal?

---

For example: Is it to build trust before a meeting, or to generate cold inquiries from the site?

✅ **Example Answer:**

*"We design modern, ergonomic office furniture that helps people work comfortably and efficiently. We started this brand after struggling with back pain from poorly designed chairs. Our goal is to make workspaces healthier and more productive.""We want a site that acts as a 'digital handshake.' When I meet an ASX board member, I want them to visit the site and immediately feel that we are a tier-one operation that handles complexity with ease."*

## 03: The "De-Clutter" Goal: Which associations are we moving away from?

---

You mentioned wanting to remove references to previous associations. What is the main message we should lead with instead?

✅ **Example Answer:**

"I want to move away from the 'boutique subcontractor' image and pivot toward being a 'Lead Strategy Architect' for Parachute. The focus should be on our independent authority.”

## 05: How should your LinkedIn profile support the site?

---

As we fold this into a LinkedIn rewrite, what is the one key takeaway you want someone to have after seeing your profile banner and headline?

✅ **Example Answer:**

"I want them to see 'Stability' and 'Precision.' The LinkedIn should look like a professional extension of the website's 'Mineral' aesthetic.”

Even though we are building a custom-engineered site, I will provide you with a **Simple Edit**
